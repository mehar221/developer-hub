## What is an APM Probe?
APM probe or Application Performance Monitoring Probe is used to query a resource value on a specific APM system such as Prometheus or AppDynamics and compare it to an expected value. The APM probe is currently supported only on Kubernetes, that too while using a Kubernetes Infrastructure that is driven by Harness Delegate. The APM probe uses Harness Platform connectors for securely storing the credentials of the target APM system in the Harness Security Manager or HSM.

![APM Probe](./static/apm-probe/apm-probe/apm-probe.png)

The usage of an APM probe is exactly the same as the other probes where the probe is added in a chaos experiment in one of the probe modes such as Continuous, Edge, SOT or EOT. The probe when successfully executed will result in either SUCCESS or FAILED state and this state contributes to the overall resilience score of the chaos experiment.

When will you use it?
APM probes are used when your application is being monitored by an APM system. The chaos experiment injects controlled faults either into an application or the associated infrastructure and the resilience of the system is observed by running multiple APM probes. The APM probe can also be used in combination with other probes such as Command or Http.

## Supported APM probe types

## Configure APM Probes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="prometheus" label="Prometheus" default>

Prometheus probe allows you to run Prometheus queries and match the resulting output against specific conditions. You can define metrics-based SLOs in a declarative way and determine the experiment verdict based on their success. The probe runs the query on a Prometheus server defined by the endpoint and checks whether the output satisfies the specified criteria. The outcome of a PromQL query (that is provided) is used for probe validation.

#### Prerequisites
To use the Prometheus APM probe, you need:

* A running Prometheus server
* Access to the Prometheus API endpoint from the kubernetes execution plane
* Proper configuration of your application to expose metrics to Prometheus

#### Interactive Setup Guide

Follow along with this interactive guide to learn how to configure Prometheus probe:

    ![Configure Details](./static/prometheus-probe/configure-details.png)

9. Under Probe Properties pass the value of required parameters
   * **TLS Config**:
     * It offers a mechanism to validate TLS certifications for the Prometheus server. You can supply the `cacert` or the client certificate and client key to perform the validation. Alternatively, you have the option to enable the `insecureSkipVerify` check to bypass certificate validation.
     * For more details, refer to [Prometheus TLS configuration documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#tls_config).
     * **CA File**: The `caFile` holds the file path of the CA certificates utilized for server TLS verification
     * **Cert File**: The `certFile` holds the file path of the client certificates utilized for TLS verification
     * **Key File**: The `keyFile` holds the file path of the client key utilized for TLS verification
     * **Insecure Skip Verify**: The `insecureSkipVerify` setting skips the TLS certificates checks
   * **Query**:
     * The query contains the PromQL query to extract out the desired Prometheus metrics via running it on the given Prometheus endpoint
     * Please Note that all the double quotes need to be parsed in the provided query.
     * **Example**: `avg_over_time(probe_duration_seconds{job=\"prometheus-blackbox-exporter\",instance=\"frontend.boutique.svc.cluster.local:80\"}[60s:1s])*1000`
