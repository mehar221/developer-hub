Learn how to use Artifact Registry with the Continuous Delivery (CD) module to simplify artifact management, ensure traceability, and streamline deploymentsâ€”especially for use cases like deploying generic artifacts to serverless platforms.

:::info Why Integrate Artifact Registry with Continuous Delivery?
Integrating Harness Artifact Registry (HAR) with CD enables you to:
- Store and version deployment artifacts in a central, secure location.
- Deploy artifacts to various platforms including serverless (AWS Lambda) and container orchestration (Kubernetes).
- Maintain traceability from artifact creation to deployment.
- Simplify management of deployment assets across environments.

## Supported CD Steps
Artifact Registry is supported as a native artifact source in select CD steps. Currently supported:
- **AWS Lambda**.
- **Kubernetes**.
<!-- Placeholder: More supported CD steps will be added here as they become available. -->
