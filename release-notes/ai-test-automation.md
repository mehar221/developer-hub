#### Enhancements and Bug Fixes


- **Duplicate Test Suite Execution Prevention (AI-1531)**
An idempotency guard has been added to prevent duplicate test suite executions caused by task redelivery scenarios in Redis-based environments. This fix enhances reliability by ensuring that each suite runs only once per trigger.
- **Cross-Origin Iframe Value Verification Fix (AI-1457)**
Improved the Expected Value Agent to accurately verify values inside cross-origin iframes by incorporating frame path resolution and automatic screenshot capture. This fix resolves validation issues during cross-origin test scenarios.
- **Set Custom Headers from Parameters (AI-1530)**
Enhanced flexibility by allowing users to configure custom headers for test suites through parameter values defined at the app-suite scope. The system now follows a clear precedence chain (parameter → config → default) for header resolution.
- **Store Specific Response Paths in API Call Command (AI-1538)**
Added support for defining a JSONPath within the API call command to capture and store a specific part of the API response. This improvement aligns with the API Interception feature and increases precision in response validation.
- **Improved Parameter Field Handling in API Call Command (AI-1546)**
Enhanced the parameter field in the API call command to support direct selection from existing parameters via `paramInputOptions`, replacing the old manual naming flow. This update improves the configuration experience and prevents redundant parameter declarations.
- **Default Checkboxes in Test Suite Run Page (AI-1545)**
Added a “Select All” checkbox capability in the Test Suite Run page for improved usability when managing large test suites. This update also replaces the previous custom checkbox logic with the native `TableList` checkbox implementation, resolving styling and selection behavior issues.
- **Auto-Refresh for Custom Headers Parameter (AI-1563)**
Enhanced header management logic to automatically set or refresh custom HTTP headers whenever the `CUSTOM_HTTP_HEADERS` parameter is updated. This ensures header configurations remain synchronized without requiring manual refresh or login task completion.
- **Added Enum and Intermediate Representation (IR) Support for Prompt Scoring (AI-1529)**
Introduced support for new Enum and Intermediate Representation (IR) commands to enhance prompt scoring capabilities. This update improves how user prompt understandability scores are handled and serialized across components, ensuring more consistent and testable scoring logic.
- **Updated Enums, Mappings, and Helper Functions (AI-1556)**
Refined the internal command flow by updating Enums and mappings and introducing helper functions for `FINALLY_BEGIN` and `FINALLY_END`. These updates improve system stability and ensure better control flow handling during test execution and teardown processes.
- **Fix for Prompt Scoring Enum Integration (AI-1574)**
Resolved a build-time issue where `USER_PROMPT_UNDERSTANDABILITY_SCORE` was missing from the Command Enum. The fix ensures the new Enum value is recognized correctly during compilation, stabilizing the build process and maintaining prompt scoring functionality.
